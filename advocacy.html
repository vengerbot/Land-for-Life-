    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Land for Life began in 2024 as a small group of students passionate about protecting forests 
      and wildlife in their communities. Troubled by the rapid deforestation and habitat loss 
      around them, they decided to take action by raising awareness, planting trees, and engaging 
      local schools and families in environmental programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, our initiative grew into a full-fledged advocacy group, partnering with 
      environmental organizations, local governments, and global networks. Today, we continue 
      to fight for sustainable land use, conservation of biodiversity, and policies that 
      protect future generations.

      <h2>Who I am</h2>
      <p>
       I am a PSHS SMC scholar from the Philippines. I created this advocacy to spread awareness of the rapidly increasing
       danger that we are putting our land through, and to stop more destruction towards the living creatures and things in this
       world.
