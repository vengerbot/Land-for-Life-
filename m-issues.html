            <h3>Specific 1: Deforestation</h3>
            <p>Deforestation is one of the biggest threats to the environment today. Large areas of forest are cleared for agriculture, logging, and urban development, leading to habitat loss and reduced biodiversity. Without trees, soil erosion increases, water quality decreases, and carbon dioxide levels rise, contributing to climate change. Preventing deforestation requires sustainable land use, responsible farming practices, and stronger conservation policies.</p>

            <h3>Specific 2: Animal Endangerment</h3>
            <p>Many animals are becoming endangered because their natural habitats are being destroyed or polluted. Species such as birds, mammals, and insects depend on forests and grasslands to survive, but human activities continue to push them closer to extinction. Protecting wildlife involves preserving their habitats, reducing hunting and illegal trade, and supporting conservation programs that help endangered species recover.</p>

            <h3>Specific 3: Forest cleanliness</h3>
            <p>Maintaining forest cleanliness is essential for keeping ecosystems healthy. Litter, pollutants, and unmanaged waste can harm animals, plants, and water sources within forest areas. Clean forests also prevent the spread of disease and reduce fire risks. Simple actions such as proper waste disposal, community clean-ups, and responsible use of forest areas can help keep natural environments safe and thriving.</p>
