                <h3>What is SDG 15 all about?</h3>
                <p>SDG 15, also known as Life on Land, addresses the growing problem of environmental degradation. 
                    Forests are being destroyed at concerning rates, biodiversity is practically declining, and many species face potential extinction. 
                    Land is also suffering from desertification, soil erosion, and loss of fertility due to unsustainable farming, mining, 
                    and many other factors. Globally, forest area declined from 31.9 % in 2000 to 31.2 % in 2020, amounting to a net loss of nearly 100 million hectares of forest.</p>

                <p>According to icpac.medium.com, most countries have acknowledged the significance of SDG 15, and they have integrated it into their national policies and plans. Governments have undertaken several actions to support this goal such as establishing protected areas, formulating sustainable 
                    land management strategies, and promoting biodiversity conservation (United Nations, 2023).</p>
