        <p>I built this website on SDG 15: Life on Land because I wanted to show how fragile and beautiful our forests, wildlife, and natural habitats are. By combining real stories, 
            images, and practical ways to help, I hope to inspire people to care for nature and take small steps that make a big difference.</p>

        <p>As a child, I used to watch birds nesting in the trees near my home, and over the years, I noticed fewer and fewer returning each season. This website shares that
             kind of story of how human activity affects the creatures 
            and plants around us, and encourages visitors to protect the habitats that many species call home.</p>

    <p>A future where humans and nature thrive together is possible, and this website is a step toward that vision. It highlights the beauty and importance of biodiversity, the threats facing our ecosystems, and the ways each of us can play a role in protecting life on land for generations to come.</p>
